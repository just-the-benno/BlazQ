# Episode 04 - Couch Coop

The episode will air on Thursday, 11 Feb, 8 PM PST at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/justthebenno).

Watch the teaser on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/HUS3p9uvQrM). 

## Content

In this episode, we can focus on developing the game. We start by adding the possibility to create multiple player profiles. From that point, we are moving towards the logic and visual of playing with various players. First, we talk about the game mechanic, implemented hotkeys, the game flow, and finally, a new result page.  

## Get started by cloning the rep

> You could start with the episode, but before you need to have set up your development machine. You can find [here](https://github.com/just-the-benno/BlazQ/tree/main/episode1) instructions per system (setup-windows.md etc).

The recommended way is cloning the repository. 

```
git clone https://github.com/just-the-benno/BlazQ.git
```

and navigate to the directory ```episode4/BlazQ.Episode4/BlazQ.Episode4```. Open this directory with VS code, and you are prepared.

It is the content of episode 03 with a little bit of clean up code. Besides, to speed up the design process, there are some changes in the ```app.css`` with additional classes. 

## Learning outcome

We should see it's good to go tiny steps during development. With each step, we are getting closer to the goal. With each step, we are getting more confident that we are building the right thing.

Besides, this time we have a solid foundation from where we start. It's good to know that we can continually create more complex things from less complex ones. Besides, we have to do very little extra work, that the recent changes, have the same look and feel like the old application.

However, the main objective should be to see how much fun coding is. We created our own game. We thought about all the different ways players can trick us and how to prevent them. So again, it is fun and creative.

# Episode 01 - Move it!

> The episode will air on Thursday, 21st January 2021, at 8 pm PST. Participate live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/justthebenno)

## Content

The first episode is an introduction. It has a slightly different structure than the upcoming episode. 

### What is BlazQ

As mentioned, a considerable part of the introduction is about the project's motivation and the expected target audience: Beginners. And - of course - we will have a look at how the final game could look. 
We spent some time talking about learning values. These values are the foundation to create a safe learning environment. 

### Preparing the development machine

Before we can start coding, we need to set up the environment. Fortunately, this is not a struggle. Just three applications are required.

+ [Setup on Windows](setup-windows.md)
+ [Setup on macOS](setup-macos.md)
+ [Setup on Linux](setup-linux.md) 

### Say Hello to Blazorly

Now is the time to get the mind into the coding space. We have an image of Blazorly, the quizmaster, and need to animate it.
Blazorly will move from left to right, up and down on the screen. And we can adjust the speed, too. This is done using each program's essential ingredients: control structures (conditions and loops), variables, and operators. 
The last exercise is about finding a more generalized way to think about motion. We introduce the concept of paths. Empowered with it, we can create complex movement instruction.   

## Get started 

The directory is named **BlazQ.Episode1** contains the starting point for this session. 

You can clone this repo. 

```
git clone https://github.com/just-the-benno/BlazQ.git
```

And navigate to the path *episode1*. For Visual Studio users, open the solution file *"BlazQ.Episode1.sln*. VS code users, as recommended, open the inner *BlazQ.Episode1* directory with Visual Studio Code. You can run the application by pressing F5 or got the **Debug View** and choose the option "Launch and Debug" and hit the green play button.   

## Learning outcome

The first episode has a lot to take in. We start coding right away. The outcome for this session is to be curious what else you could accomplish and how is it possible that every program, in essence,
is only made from variables and control structures.  

## Feedback form

BlazQ is feedback-driven. The feedback provided by you helps me to improve the learning experience for everyone. I highly encourage you to take the time to fill out the form. The results and what changed based on them will be discussed in the next session.

If you didn't enjoy the experience, think about the why and feel free to send me your feedback directly or fill out the feedback form.
